# Custom profiles

Multiple profiles can be defines and switched between at runtime
or set at process start-up.

## Configuring the default profile

The default profile is automatically the top (first)
defined profile in the configuration file, but
can be explicitly set to an order-independant name
using `default_profile` configuration key.

    default_profile: main
