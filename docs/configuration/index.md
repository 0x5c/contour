# Configuring Contour

The main configuration file will be read from and auto-generated to
`~/.config/contour/contour.yml` on Unix systems and on Windows systems
`%LocalAppData%\contour\contour.yml`.

Note, on Unix systems, the environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (defaulting to `~/.config`) will be respected.
